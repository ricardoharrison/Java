# HTML Server

This program consist of a simple HTTP server that reads HTML files. Currently, the folder contains only one HTML file, but more can be added mantaining the functionality.

To appropiately load the file, open a browser and type the following URL (or click on the link):
[http://localhost:8765/index.html](http://localhost:8765/index.html). This URL can be modified to load other files contained in the project once they are added (http://localhost:8765/**filename**).
