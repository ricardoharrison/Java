# Lift Control Simulation

This Java application simulates a lift control system using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and multithreading to handle the real-time operations of each lift. The program consists of a Control Room window that displays the status of each lift and individual windows for each lift that allow users to control the movement between floors.

For simplicity, the simulation is currently configured with two lifts, each operating independently and communicating with the Control Room via UDP.
